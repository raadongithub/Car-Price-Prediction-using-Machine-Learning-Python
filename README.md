# Car-Recommendation-System-using-Machine-Learning-Python
This Python project utilizes Machine Learning techniques to predict the prices of used cars using a dataset sourced from PakWheels. The dataset encompasses various attributes such as car model, manufacturer, mileage, and more. By employing libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Plotly, users can delve into data insights via interactive visualizations and predict car prices based on specific parameters. Additionally, the project incorporates preprocessing methods to address missing data and outliers, enhancing the accuracy of price predictions.
